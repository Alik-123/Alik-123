- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Margarita. I was born in Russia. Received my M.Sc. in chemistry from Mendeleev's University of Chemical Technology in 1987, M.Sc. in Physics from Moscow State University in 1991, and a Ph.D. in Astrophysics from University of Delhi, Dept. Physics & Astrophysics in 2002.
I worked in Cambridge, UK; Tehran, Iran, and from 2006 working in Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bangalore. I am also a visiting faculty 
at M.P. Birla Institute of Fundamental Research, Bangalore. 
My research interests are application of gravitational lensing in astrophysics and cosmology; UV astronomy from space and near space; 
exoplanets and habitability. I also love observing comets!
